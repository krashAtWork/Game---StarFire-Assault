# Learning Notes – Starfire Assault

This game was built entirely from scratch using Python and Pygame.  
Here’s what I learned while making it:

---

## 1. Game Window Setup
- Initialized Pygame and created an 800×600 display window.
- Learned how to set window captions and icons.

---

## 2. Background & Audio
- Added a static background image to make the game more immersive.
- Used `pygame.mixer.music` for looping background music.
- Learned to adjust audio volume and trigger sound effects for specific events.

---

## 3. Player Control
- Mapped left/right arrow keys to control horizontal movement.
- Reset movement when keys are released to prevent continuous sliding.
- Implemented boundary checks so the player stays on screen.

---

## 4. Enemy Management
- Spawned multiple enemies with randomized horizontal positions.
- Made enemies bounce at screen edges and drop down after each bounce.
- Learned to manage enemy positions and speeds using lists.

---

## 5. Bullet Mechanics
- Allowed only one bullet on screen at a time using a `visible_bullet` flag.
- Learned to “detach” bullet movement from player position once fired.
- Reset bullet position when it goes off-screen or hits an enemy.

---

## 6. Collision Detection
- Used Euclidean distance formula to check hits:
  ```python
  math.sqrt((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2) < threshold
