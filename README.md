# Starfire Assault 🚀

A simple 2D space shooter game built entirely from scratch using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).  
You control a rocket ship, dodge incoming enemies, and shoot them down for points.  
This was created as a personal project to learn the fundamentals of game development.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Player movement**: Use ← and → arrow keys to move.
- **Shooting**: Press ↑ to fire bullets (only one on screen at a time).
- **Enemies**: Move horizontally, bounce off walls, and drop closer each time they hit an edge.
- **Game Over**: If an enemy reaches too close to the bottom, the game ends.
- **Scoring**: +1 point for each enemy destroyed.
